<p>Shanks Red-Haired Shanks is a legendary and powerful pirate in the Grand Line, being the captain of the Red Haired Pirate Crew and one of the Four Emperors in the second half of the grand line.

    Shanks was born 39 years ago in a wine producing town somewhere in West Blue, a year before the God Valley incident. 38 years ago, for reasons unknown, Shanks was found at God Valley in a treasure chest by Roger and Rayleigh who subsequently took him in. It is unknown whether he was born on the island or hailed elsewhere.

    He was around the age of 9, when he became an apprentice pirate alongside Buggy the Clown aboard the Oro Jackson, the pirate ship of Gol D. Roger.
    
    During this time, he and Buggy would often argue over trivial matters, earning them a scolding from the First Mate Silvers Rayleigh. One night, Shanks surprised Buggy by trying to tell him of what the Captain did, this caused Buggy to accidentally swallow the Chop-Chop fruit. Acting quickly, Shanks dove into the sea to rescue him, though Buggy held a grudge for costing him a fortune for several years.
    
    27 years ago at age 12, the crew faced off against the Golden Lion Pirates led by Shiki. Shanks was seen trying to calm a panicking Buggy about the impending battle, to no avail. A year later, they faced off against the Whitebeard pirates for days and nights. Then, he met Marshall D. Teach for the first time, expressing jealousy when Buggy told him that Teach has never slept a day in his life.
    
    He and the others were initially skeptical of Kozuki Oden after he was recruited but after some time they grew fond of him. Shanks also befriended Inuarashi and Nekomamushi while they were on board. The crew had many adventures including going to Fishman Island and Skypeia before they made their way to Laugh Tale. However, Shanks and Buggy were unable to go after Buggy fell ill and Shanks stayed behind to tend to him. Upon the crew returning, Roger had been labeled the Pirate King. Shanks witnessed Roger disband the crew and shed tears at parting with Roger and Oden.
    
    At age 15, Shanks witnessed Roger's execution in Loguetown, shedding tears for his former captain. After the event, he started making plans to form his own crew and spoke to Buggy about One Piece. Shanks revealed that he was not ready to go after the treasure before he asked Buggy to join his crew, but Buggy was upset Shanks was not going to be Roger's successor and refused to work for him. This would be the last time they meet until twenty two years later, though Shanks heard rumors of Buggy being a pirate.
    
    Since the Roger Pirates disbanded, he set out on his own, gathering new crewmates and became the captain of the Red Hair Pirates. He sailed through the Grand Line, visiting all seas, spending most of his time partying, the occasional duels with his rival Dracule Mihawk and having a fun time.
    
    More than 20 years ago, at age 19, Shanks took care of his adopted baby daughter Uta on his ship. He then sang her a song to soothe her, which cultivated her love for songs in adulthood, eventually making her a well-known idol.
    
    At some point in time, he fought Marshall D. Teach who left a permanent scar on his right eye. Ever since, he has remained wary of the latter and his intentions.
    
    13 years ago, when Shanks was 26, he and his crew attacked a government and Gomu Gomu no Mi Devil Fruit that was guarded by CP9 agent Who's-Who. They were able to pillage the ship and take the devil fruit.
    
    A year later, he was at the East Blue and he met the young Monkey D. Luffy in Foosha village, an island in the eastern part of the Goa kingdom. His bounty was revealed to be 1 040 000 000 billion berries in the One Piece Red movie at this time. Around the same time, Shanks became acquainted with Luffy and they formed a friendship while they were in Makino's bar the mountain bandits led by Higuma the bear entered as they were looking for sake. Shanks gave Higuma the remaining sake and Higuma said it wasn't enough and threw it at Shanks, who laughed it off. When that was happening Luffy got mad at Shanks and ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi Devil Fruit. Seeing this, Shanks told him to spit out the fruit but it was too late, so Shanks explained devil fruits take away one's ability to swim forever.
    
    After that, Luffy got into a fight with the mountain bandits, which caused the Red Hair Pirates to look outside and see Luffy being in trouble after one of the mountain bandits placed a gun at Shanks' head but Lucky Reaux shot the bandit. Shanks' first mate Benn Beckman which caused the mountain bandits to fight and end up defeated but their leader Higuma used a smoke bomb to go to the ocean and dump Luffy there but then a sea king attacked which killed Higuma but Luffy escaped and tried frantically to stay afloat. The sea king moved to attack Luffy but Shanks intervened to save Luffy, losing his left arm in the process. With his Haoshoku haki, he scared the sea king away and comforted Luffy. However, Luffy broke down because Shanks lost a limb for him but pirate paid it no mind. He later gave Luffy his straw hat with a promise to return it to him when he becomes stronger and they meet again.
    
    Around this time (more than a decade ago), Shanks left Uta behind so she wouldn’t be chased by the world for being his daughter. He wanted to keep her on board his crew coinciding with her own desire, but had to take the blame for a genocide, causing them to separate. Her talent was too great, and he didn’t want to impede her future. He would frequently keep up with her new releases like a proud father.
    
    Upon returning to the Grand Line, he was reunited with Rayleigh at Saobody Archipelago and the latter asked about his Straw Hat and lost arm. Shanks informed him about Luffy and how he was similar to Roger, causing Rayleigh to yearn to meet the boy. In an earlier point in time, Shanks ceased dueling with Mihawk because he lost his arm but they stayed on good terms, as Shanks told him about Luffy.
    
    At another point, he was recognized by the world as one of the Yonko, being the youngest pirate to hold the title.
    
    Three years ago, Portgas D. Ace set out to sea and tracked Shanks and his crew to an island. Shanks initially assumed that the young pirate came to challenge him, ready to unsheathe his sword. However, Ace quickly told him that he was not there for a fight and he only came to thank Shanks for saving his younger brother. Shanks realized that Ace was Luffy's brother, becoming delighted as he didn't know Luffy had a brother. He invited Ace and his crew to party with him becoming good friends not too long later. </p>
